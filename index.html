      The Eastern Mountain Gorillas are some of the rarest animals on the planet
      . Only 1000 are left in the wild mostly found in Uganda and they are very shy.These gorillas can weight 
      upwards of 450 lbs. You would think something that big would be easy to find right? On this adventure you will
      find the answer.
